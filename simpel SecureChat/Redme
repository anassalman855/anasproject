- `client1.py` – First client application with GUI and AES encryption.
- `client2.py` – Second client application with GUI and AES encryption.

## 🔐 Features
- End-to-end message encryption with **AES**.
- Real-time chat between two clients.
- Simple graphical interface using **Tkinter**.
- Multi-threaded communication for smooth performance.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3 installed and install the required package:
```bash
pip install cryptography
